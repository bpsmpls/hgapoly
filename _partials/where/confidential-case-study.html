								<p>To respond to their strategic vision of aligning services and quality of inpatient environments across multiple campuses, a confidential client engaged HGA to develop prototypical private patient rooms and inpatient units that meet critical to quality criteria. This investigation measured the staff membersâ€™ overall wellbeing as it relates to people, process, place, and technology. The findings from this investigation are helping to inform the design solutions for the new campuses. HGA went through a research-based process as well as created a beautiful human-centered, state-of-the-art design that is efficient to operate and accepts the future.</p>
