								<p> The intent of an evidence-based design (EBD) approach is to make informed design decisions with empirical evidence to improve outcomes. Furthermore, post-occupancy evaluations validate that process improvement strategies implemented have met a level of success.</p>

								<p>At HGA we combine these two ways of design thinking in an integrated process. Important components used during the Froedtert Hospital include discovering current-state, applying evidence and testing solutions during pre-design to predicting outcomes, verifying impact of design and evolving findings for future projects during post-occupancy.</p>

								<p>Baseline data gathered led to the development of critical-to-quality metrics that were used to guide planning and design decisions. Common travel paths uncovered during shadowing were diagrammed in the three proposed prototypes to compare differences in travel distances. These activities were paramount in receiving buy-in from stakeholders for room count and size. In addition, future-state predictions were made by comparing current-state results to a benchmark database. For example, one design assumption estimated that approximately six to nine percent of nurses’ time spent traveling would be saved and transferred to time spent in patient rooms.</p>

								<p>Furthermore, to ensure that our design solutions meet a level of success, the same research tools used during pre-design were implemented in a three-phased post-occupancy evaluation. Shadow data was collected at three, eight and 12 months post-occupancy to understand if assumptions and predictions made during pre-design were upheld. After each phase, the unit manager received a brief report that summarized the findings and provided operational suggestions to further enhance workflow.</p>

								<p>The phased approach successfully documented how nurses’ workflow became more efficient within the space over time. As predicted, time spent traveling significantly decreased (p< 0.001) by 6% or 36 minutes per nurse. Nurses on average traveled 2.08 miles, which is one of the lowest recorded statistics compared to other benchmark decentralized units.</p>
